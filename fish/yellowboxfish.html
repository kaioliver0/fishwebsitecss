        <h1>Yellow Box Fish</h1>

        <p>The yellow box fish is visually distinct due to its cube-like shape and bright coloring. Their natural habitat is within coral and rocky reefs. 
            Adult yellow box fish are solitary, and tend to live in areas with plentiful crevices and ledges, which they use for shelter. They feed on molluscs,
            crustaceans, worms, algae and smaller fish, and tend to be around 45 cm in length.

        <h1>Anglerfish</h1>

        <p>Found all over the world, anglerfish species tend to be extremely sexually dimorphic,
            meaning that male anglerfish are very different from female anglerfish.  In many 
            anglerfish species, females are much larger than males, with a luminescent organ known 
            as an esca at the top of their heads. This glowing organ lures prey towards the carnivorous
            fish and attracts males to facilitate mating. When a male finds a female to mate with, the
            small fish bites into the female's skin and releases an enzyme that breaks down the skin of 
            both her body and his mouth, essentially fusing the two fish together. The male and female fish 
            now share a circulatory system, and the male depends on the female for nutrients. In return, the 
            female is now able to produce offspring. This fusion lasts for the rest of their lives. It is 
            common for multiple males to be attached to a single female, although some taxa are monogamous.

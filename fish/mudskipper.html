        <h1>Mudskippers</h1>

        <p>Mudskippers are unique both for their strange appearance and for their ability to survive out of water. They are a brownish green color, and males 
            can develop brightly colored spots during mating season in order to attract females. Their heads are flat, with their eyes protruding from the top. 
            they also have long bodies, with side fins that function similarly to legs and allow them to move on land. Due to these unique fins, they are also 
            able to leap up to two feet. Mudskippers typically live in burrows, and are very active when out of water, which is where they eat, court one another,
            and defend their territory. They are able to survive in air by utilizing water stored in their large gill chambers, as well as by absorbing oxygen
            in the lining of their mouth and throat. Despite their vast adaptability, they must take care to stay in the mud, lest they dry out in the sun. </p>
